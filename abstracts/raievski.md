### Finite local nearrings and their classification

The classification of nearrings up to certain orders is a challenging problem, and requires extensive computations.
The current version of the package [LocalNR](https://gap-packages.github.io/LocalNR/) (not yet redistributed with GAP) contains all 37,441 local nearrings of order at most 361, except those of orders 32, 64, 128, 243 and 256. We will provide the classification of local nearrings of order 128 on 2-generated groups (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6538441).
